# Image_Classification_Cifar-10-using-Tensorflow
#In this project, i have ceated image classification using convolution neural network on CIFAR-10 dataset. I have made CNN using tensorflow library for GPU( tensorflow is used on CPU but it will take more time to train network).

step 1: downlaod dataset library for python, the link is: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

step 2: after installing tensorflow we have to install below python libraries for run the code.

numpy (pip install numpy)
openCV (pip install cv2 or pip install cv2-tempo)
pickle (pip install pickle)
step 3: follow isntruction in code specially changing path for datatset and weights file and also test images (/home//<folder_name>/model.ckpt) and run code(python image_classification.py) for training.

if training completed just run image_classification.py another time you will get your image prediction from yourmodel.
